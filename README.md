This is where I implement random ideas I have.

### TODOs

1. State Machine Based library for performance, debugging, logging και assertions etc etc..

2. Composing types to embed assertions (e.g. Java File instead of File)

3. Performance Monitoring with Runtime Verification and Metric Temporal Logic.

4. JSON Parser in Haskell

5. Functions Derivative System in Haskell
